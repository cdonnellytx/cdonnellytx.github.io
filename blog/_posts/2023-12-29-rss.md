So I saw the [Please, Expose Your RSS](https://rknight.me/please-expose-your-rss/) going around Mastodon of late, and decided to fix the nonexisten RSS on my blog over the holiday break.

I followed the instructions from [Adding an RSS feed to GitHub Pages](https://dzhavat.github.io/2020/01/19/adding-an-rss-feed-to-github-pages.html) and got it up in under an hour.
